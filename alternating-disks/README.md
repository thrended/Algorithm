Project 1 alternating disks

This project analyzes and implements two algorithms to solve the alternating disk problem, where a row of disks with alternating colors is sorted using these two methods. A mathematical analysis was conducted on the pseudocode. First, I used the RAM step count model to produce an equation approximating each algorithm's runtime. Asymptotic analysis was then performed on the functions. Finally, proofs by definition and limit theorem were used to determine each algorithm's overall efficiency class. The C++ implementation performed as expected based on the calculated results.
