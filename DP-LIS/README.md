# Project-4-dynamic-programming-LIS

In this project I implemented a more efficient dynamic programming algorithm was to solve the LIS (longest increasing subsequence) problem which we previously encountered in project 2. The algorithm is supposed to run in time complexity O(n^2) instead of O(2^n) as in project 2. Data for various input sizes was collected and analyzed. The remainder of the project compared our new efficient algorithm to the previous powerset method, supporting the claims of both hypotheses.
