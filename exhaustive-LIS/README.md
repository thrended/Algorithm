# Project-2-longest-increasing-exhaustive
exhaustive optimization algorithm for longest increasing subsequence

This project implements an exponential time algorithm which returns the longest increasing subsequence within an arbitrary list of numbers. The algorithm was mathematically analyzed and compared with empirical data collected from a range of input sizes. The observed performance was exactly in line with the expected results and supported the claims of both hypotheses.
